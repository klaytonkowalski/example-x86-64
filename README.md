# x86-64 Assembly

Example of x86-64 assembly language programs.

These programs are solutions to many of the suggested projects in the book "x86-64 Assembly Language Programming with Ubuntu" by Ed Jorgensen. Only problems that I felt contributed to my understanding of the material are included. The code is not perfectly written nor well commented, however all solutions give the correct result when viewed through a debugger.
